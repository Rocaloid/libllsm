Low Level Speech Model for high quality speech analysis and synthesis.

LLSM is an extended *Harmonic + Noise Model* with turbulent noise modeling, shape-invariant phase preservation and a range of other techniques combined.

It is designed to be an **interpolatable**, **low-level** speech representation for **high quality** speech/singing synthesis, which means

* we're willing to sacrifice some storage consumption in exchange for better quality;
* we assume the noise/distortion in the input is negligible;
* data frames can be easily interpolated with little quality loss;
* the model deals with really low-level aspects in speech parameterization;
* where "low-level aspects" can be amplitudes of harmonics, f0, and spectral envelope; semantics of the context would be a counterexample;
